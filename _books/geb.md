Intense read. Teaches computer science concepts through mutliple lenses. A lot of references. From Wikipedia: "It also discusses self-reference and formal rules, isomorphism, what it means to communicate, how knowledge can be represented and stored, the methods and limitations of symbolic representation, and even the fundamental notion of "meaning" itself."
